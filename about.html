          <p>
            I'm Douwe and i'm currently 19 years old. As said before, i'm a
            student at De Hogeschool van Amsterdam and i'm currently studying
            Communication and Multimedia Design.

          <p id="small-text">What do i like to do?</p>
          <p>
            In my free time i mostly like to play games, draw and have fun with
            friends. Thats also why i like working in groups because its more
            fun, and i like meeting new people. I also participate in Tennis and
            like to visit second hand stores.

          <p id="small-text">What are my interests?</p>
          <p>
            I'm mostly interested in Graphig Design and Programming, so thats
            the reason i plan of focusing on those subjects in my second year.
            I'm also interested in working with tiny computers like Arduino's
            and RasberryPI, and building contraptions with them.

          <p id="small-text">Where do i see myself in the future?</p>
          <p>
            In the future i will probably be working for a big company which
            specialises in either graphic design or programming. At the same
            time i wouldn't be suprised if i have my own little group that i
            make websites with. I would love to work in both the design and
            programming side at the same time.
